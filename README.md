# Image Classifier Webapp Using Tensorflow.js

This is a simple image classifier using TensorFlow.js. This image classifier was created by following the instructions [Google Transfer Learning Image Classifier Tutorial](https://www.tensorflow.org/js/tutorials/transfer/image_classification)

## What it does?
- It uses the feed through webcam 
- You can save various objects or images into classes so that they can be used to classify later.
- Each time you click one of the "Add" buttons, one image is added to that class as a training example.
- At the same time the model continues to make predictions on webcam images coming in and shows the results in real time.
